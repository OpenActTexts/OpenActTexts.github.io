#### Open Actuarial Textbooks Project

The project goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

## Loss Data Analytics

### Book Description
*Loss Data Analytics* is an interactive, online, freely available text.
* The online version contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* One day, we hope that the online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. (Habla Español? For spanish-speaking students, [the book has translated](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDASpanish/), primarily by the actuarial group at the Universitat de Barcelona.)

### An Open Book
An up to date version of the book is available in three formats, html, pdf, and epub.
* View the [online version](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) in *.html* format - this is the **interactive** version.

You can download **pdf** and **epub** (current and older) versions of the text in our [Offline versions of the text](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/DownloadOffline.html).

### Short Course
Version 1.0 of an innovative [Short Course](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDACourse1/) is now available. This online tutorial contains 34 short videos that review the basic learning objectives of the first five chapters of *Loss Data Analytics.* Throughout the short course, users can sharpen their understanding of *Loss Data Analytics* by practicing on exercise tutorials (52 in total) that implement *Loss Data Analytics* concepts using the *R* statistical language.

### Usage Data
For the book, and many of the supporting projects, we now provide [Google Analytics Usage Data](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/GoogleAnalyticsUsage.html). These statistics help to demonstrate the impact of this project on actuarial education.

### R Codes for Loss Data Analytics
* As another method of learning, you can also get practice executing *R* code at our [Online Version R Code Site](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/LDARcode). This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. 
* [Data](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDARcode/tree/master/Data) are also available. Click individual files and hit the "Raw" button to download the raw data, not an html version.
* Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDARCode).
