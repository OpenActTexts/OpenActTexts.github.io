# Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

## Loss Data Analytics

### Book Description
*Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.
* The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

To see our progress, a draft of the book is available at
* [Online Version](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html)
* [pdf version](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Offline/LossDataAnalytics.pdf)
* [EPUB version](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Offline/LossDataAnalytics.epub)

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics).

### How to contribute
1. In order to contribute to any Github repo in general, and the actuarial open book project in particular, it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with a linux system such as Ubuntu 16.04/18.04. If you have never used linux, there would be some learning curves, but the long term benefit is very clear: as long as you are interested in data science, open source software, and scientific computing, getting used to the linux-based environment is critically important! Why not start right now. If you still need your Windows system etc., you can at least try using [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with a Ubuntu system as the guest operation system.

2. Now assume that you are working with an linux terminal, the following steps will let you get started.
    + Install `git` if you haven't (just use the command 'git', the terminal will tell you what to do next)
    + In a local folder that is devoted to your various git projects, do the following with a terminal:
        + git clone https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics.git
        + cd Loss-Data-Analytics
    + Then follow the document [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) until the 'submit' step [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962#submitting). After you submit your pull request, relax and someone will take care of your request.
    + If you are not ready to pull request, you can simply initialize an issue report by clicking [here](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/issues/new). Then relax, and someone will take care it from there.

3. Get yourself started, and it might be much easier than what you have thought. Enjoy gitting!

### R Codes for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/LDARcode)

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDARCode).

### Development Site

More recent developments of the book are available at our [Open Actuarial Textbooks Development Site](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics). In addition to beta version of the book and *R Codes*, there you will find:

### Overheads for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at a development [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).

## Life Contingencies / Actuarial Mathematics

We are also starting to organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See the development  [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).

## WordPress Experiment
We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).

## Your Help
