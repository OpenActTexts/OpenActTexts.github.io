## Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

# Loss Data Analytics

**Book Description** - *Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.
* The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

To see our progress, a draft of a few chapters of the book is available at 
*  [Online Version from R Bookdown](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/index.html) 
* [R Bookdown - pdf version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnalytics.pdf)
* [R Bookdown - EPUB version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnalytics.epub)

We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).

# R Codes for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalyticsRcode/index.html)

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsRCode).

# Overheads for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).


# Life Contingencies / Actuarial Mathematics

We are also starting to organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See our [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).
