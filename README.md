# Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

## Loss Data Analytics

### Book Description
*Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.
* The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

### An Open Book
An up to date version of the book is available in three formats:
* [Online Version](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html)
* [pdf version](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Offline/LossDataAnalytics.pdf)
* [EPUB version](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Offline/LossDataAnalytics.epub)

[Archived versions](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Offline) are also available in pdf format.

### R Codes for Loss Data Analytics
* You can get practice executing *R* code at our [Online Version R Code Site](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/LDARcode). This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. 
* [Data](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDARcode/tree/master/Data) are also available. Click individual files and hit the "Raw" button to download the raw data, not an html version.
* Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDARCode).

## Development Site
Another site is available for authors, reviewers, and others interested in the project development, our [Open Actuarial Textbooks Development Site](https://ewfrees.github.io/). This site contains:

* A [Style Guide](https://ewfrees.github.io/StyleGuideLDA/index.html) for prospective contributors
* This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at a development [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).
* We are also starting to organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See the development [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).
* We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).
* Your contributions are very much welcomed!
